                <div class="question">
                    Q: As the inaugural University Cultural Committee (UCC) of our college, how does it feel to be
                    shaping our cultural events?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>It has been an exhilarating experience! Building something from scratch is fun, and we're learning
                        how many details go into making an event successful. Our "Golden Rolodex" of talented campus
                        individuals has been a great asset, helping with everything from sound to decoration. This year,
                        our committee was faculty-led, and that guidance made a significant difference. They brought a
                        wonderful sense of discipline and structure to our events, while we, the student members,
                        infused the process with creativity and casual energy. This partnership ensured our events were
                        both well-organised and genuinely engaging.</p>
                    <p>The best part, however, has been the friendships we've built along the way. We've become a
                        close-knit team, and we're proud to shape campus culture together.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <div class="question">
                    Q: How would you rate your experience working in a faculty-led Cultural Committee compared to your
                    understanding of a student-led one?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The experience has been transformative and has offered a new, more holistic perspective on
                        organising events. In a student-led model, the energy is incredible, and we aim for excitement
                        and liveliness. The faculty leadership, however, gave the necessary guidance that we, as
                        students, tend to lack. They provided a structured vision aligned with the institution's
                        long-term values and goals, ensuring every event was not only fun but also safe and
                        sustainable.</p>
                    <p>A key advantage was their role as a bridge. They expertly connected between students, college
                        administration and potential sponsors. This insightful approach to logistics and partnerships
                        was something we hadn't fully valued before. Perhaps the most significant shift was in our own
                        perspective. Working alongside them, we saw the human side behind the titles. They became our
                        mentors, collaborators and a helping hand we could always turn to for guidance. It was a perfect
                        balance of our youthful energy and their experienced navigation.</p>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <div class="question">
                    Q: The fest was a phenomenal success. How did you and your team manage to pull off such an
                    incredible event?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Thank you! The short answer is: together. None of this would have been possible without the team.
                        Teamwork wasn't just important; it was everything.</p>
                    <p>The long answer is a little more chaotic! We've spent countless hours side by side, from dawn
                        till dusk, figuring things out together. There was pressure, excitement and moments of pure
                        exhaustion. But in between all that, there were also shared laughs, small victories, and a sense
                        of purpose that kept us going. The pain was shared, the fun was shared, and time kaise sath mein
                        beet gya wo pata hi nhi chala.</p>
                    <p>That collective spirit transforms the responsibility into an adventure. When we finally saw the
                        crowd enjoying what we had built, every long hour felt worth it. The final applause is for the
                        event, but the real reward is the unbreakable bond you form with your crew and the memories
                        you'll cherish forever.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: Where do you see the University Cultural Committee in the next five years?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>We envision a bright future for the UCC, built on the momentum we've gained this year through our
                        innovative approach and improved PR. In five years, we aim for the UCC to be the cornerstone of
                        campus spirit, creating shared memories that define student life. We anticipate significant
                        growth in corporate sponsorship, enabling us to host more renowned artists and spectacular
                        events that attract large crowds.</p>
                    <p>While specific future developments may be unpredictable: the UCC will grow and become a defining
                        pillar of the student experience at our university.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <div class="question">
                    Q: With so many people involved, how did the UCC handle the inevitable disagreements and creative
                    differences?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Disagreements weren't just inevitable; they were an essential part of the process. With so many
                        passionate students, faculty advisors, and seniors on board, clashing perspectives were
                        omnipresent.</p>
                    <p>Our approach was organic but structured. We'd often "fight it out" in debates until the best
                        option prevailed. A natural hierarchy based on responsibility helped provide direction, but it
                        was never rigid. The key was maintaining a hands-on approach at every level to ensure everyone
                        felt heard. Obviously, when exhaustion sets in, the only thing that matters is progress. In those
                        moments, our mantra became, "Whoever is willing to get it done, please do." That trust and
                        flexibility allowed people to take ownership and run with a solution, which was what truly moved
                        us forward and turned disagreement into results.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <div class="question">
                    Q: Beyond the logistics, what is the most valuable personal lesson you will take away from this
                    experience?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>This position had our team learn valuable lessons in teamwork and leadership that extend far
                        beyond event coordination. As a team, our greatest lesson was the transformative power of open
                        communication, humility, and trust. We learned to prioritize candid conversations and realized
                        that effective leadership requires detaching from titles and viewing people as individuals. This
                        experience taught us to set aside our pride, acknowledge our flaws, and ask for help when we
                        needed it.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, we learned not to take challenges personally. Letting go of minor disagreements
                        was essential for our well-being and success. By focusing on our shared mission instead of
                        individual credit, we conserved our energy for what truly mattered: supporting each other and
                        achieving our common goal. That sense of collective resilience is the lesson we will carry with
                        us into everything we do.</p>

                    Q: With so many incredible moments throughout the fest, which one stands out as the most memorable
                    for you all?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>There is one moment we will all carry with us forever. It was during the inaugural event when we
                        finally revealed the secret we'd been guarding for months. As the first chords of Mohit Chauhan's
                        iconic song echoed through the venue, the crowd erupted in cheers. The vibe was unreal.</p>
                    <div class="highlight-quote">
                        But the truly unforgettable peak came later, on the main night. After meticulous planning,
                        mounting stress and sleepless nights, watching Mohit Chauhan himself ascend the stage felt
                        surreal. When he sang "tumse hi din hota hai, surmayi shaam aati h….", we looked at each other,
                        then at the screaming, joyous crowd, and a single thought passed between us: this was the shaam
                        we'd been working for.
                    </div>
                    <p>A shaam that would stay with us forever, not just as a memory, but as a testament of what passion
                        and perseverance can create. For just a moment, it was perfectly relaxing and deeply rewarding;
                        a brief, beautiful pause in the chaos where we could simply soak it all in. It was our
                        victory.</p>

                    Q: What advice would you give to the students who will take on this role next year?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Our most crucial advice: your team is your greatest strength. Build a foundation of open
                        communication and trust. If you're struggling, speak up; if you need help, ask for it. Learn to
                        delegate, because a small, dedicated, and efficient team is far more powerful than a large,
                        disconnected one. Start your sponsorship drive early, as it is a process that always takes
                        longer than anticipated. Most importantly, maintain a humble and respectful relationship with
                        faculty advisors; their guidance is invaluable. This role is as taxing as it is rewarding, so
                        cultivate a strong support system. Keep work divisions clear, rely on each other, and you will
                        not only survive the chaos; you'll build something incredible together.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: How did you manage to balance the immense UCC responsibilities with your academic workload?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The honest truth is that it requires significant personal sacrifice and a relentless time
                        dedication. No one is perfect at time management, and you must accept that you can't do
                        everything. The key lies in setting boundaries and prioritizing what you can, making tough choices
                        about where your energy is best spent. This is where your support system becomes indispensable.
                        Having good, understanding friends who have your back, whether it's sharing notes, covering for
                        you, or just being there to listen after a long day, makes all the difference in the world. It's
                        a difficult balance, but the experience teaches you resilience and focus that prove to be
                        invaluable beyond the role.</p>
